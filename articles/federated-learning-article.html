      <p>
        As engineers and data scientists, we often focus deeply on model development and evaluation—sometimes at the expense of understanding how to communicate our work effectively to non-technical stakeholders. This realization hit home during my participation in the <strong>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Prototype (ADSP)</strong> course at <strong>Politecnico di Torino</strong>, developed in collaboration with the <strong>LINKS Foundation</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This program not only deepened our technical skills but also helped us translate research into real-world, business-relevant outcomes. One of the key achievements of our team was enhancing a <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> system on the <strong>MS MARCO</strong> dataset, resulting in a <strong>7.1% improvement</strong> in the <strong>Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)</strong> metric.
      </p>

      <h2>What is <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>RAG</strong> is a hybrid AI architecture that combines two steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Retrieval</strong>: fetching relevant documents from a knowledge base.</li>
        <li><strong>Generation</strong>: using a language model to generate responses based on those documents.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This architecture offers more grounded and factual outputs compared to standalone generative models.
      </p>

      <h2>What is <strong>MS MARCO</strong>?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>MS MARCO</strong> (Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension) is a large-scale dataset built for training and evaluating machine reading comprehension and information retrieval systems. It contains real-world user queries and human-generated answers.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Result</h2>
      <p>
        We fine-tuned both the retrieval and generation components of the RAG pipeline and evaluated it on MS MARCO. The result was a <strong>7.1% increase in MRR</strong>, demonstrating more accurate and relevant answer generation. Tools like Hugging Face Transformers, FAISS, and PyTorch were part of the tech stack used in this process.
      </p>

      <h2>Business and Communication Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        While technical improvements matter, the course taught us that success also depends on effectively communicating our work to different audiences. Below are a few tools and concepts we used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stakeholder Map</strong>: Visualizes people and organizations affected by or influencing the project.</li>
        <li><strong>Persona</strong>: Fictional user profiles used to design human-centered solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Journey Map</strong>: Illustrates how a user interacts with the system across different stages.</li>
        <li><strong>GANTT Chart</strong>: A timeline-based project planning tool showing tasks and milestones.</li>
        <li><strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</strong>: Hierarchical decomposition of project deliverables into smaller components.</li>
        <li><strong>Deliverable</strong>: A concrete output, such as a presentation, report, or model.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>One Crucial Presentation Tip</h2>
      <p>
        As engineers, we tend to follow a build-up style when presenting: start with background, describe methods, show metrics, and finally present the results. But the course taught us something very different:
      </p>
      <blockquote><em>The punchline should come at the beginning of your presentation.</em></blockquote>
      <p>
        Stakeholders from the business side have limited time and attention spans. By opening with your key improvement, you capture their interest early and leave a lasting impression.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Technical accuracy is essential, but it's not the whole story. This project showed me how combining technical development with human-centered design, ethical awareness, and communication skills leads to much greater impact. I’m thankful for this learning experience at Politecnico di Torino and the LINKS Foundation—where I learned to not just build solutions, but also deliver them meaningfully.
